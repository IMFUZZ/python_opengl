# python_opengl
A basic implementation of the library "pyOpenGL" displaying a rotating cube.

To execute "testGL.py" correcty, you'll need to download both pygame dans pyOpenGl. I recommand you use pip to install them easily.
Be also sure to use python 3.0 or earlier version to run the script as it was written in python 3.4.
